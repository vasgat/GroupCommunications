# Helios Group Communications API #

## Introduction ##

The Group Communication API offers a set of functionalities for handling one-on-one and group communications.

The Content Aware Profile Manager handles the creation of the users' interests profiles as well as the matching between users. With a user's available image collection as input, the manager can construct their interests profile using a deep learning algorithm. Futhermore, the manager can provide a metric on the quality of the match between two users based on their constructed interests profile.

HELIOS Content Aware Profiling API is one of the HELIOS Module APIs.
